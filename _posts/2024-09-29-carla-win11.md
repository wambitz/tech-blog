## Introduction

Building [CARLA](https://carla.org/), an open-source simulator for autonomous driving research, from source on Windows can be a daunting task. The maze of outdated guides, cryptic errors, and hours of compilation can leave even seasoned developers scratching their heads.

If you've been searching for the **real guide** on how to install CARLA with Windows 10 or 11 and Visual Studio 2022, look no further. This comprehensive, step-by-step tutorial consolidates official documentation, personal experience, and troubleshooting tips to save you **hours of research and headaches**.

Let's dive in and get CARLA up and running!

## Why This Guide?

- **Up-to-Date**: Tailored for CARLA v0.9.15, Windows 10/11, and Visual Studio 2022.
- **Time-Saving**: Avoid common pitfalls and errors that took me hours or even days.
- **Comprehensive**: Merges official documentation with practical insights and personal experience.

## Prerequisites

### System Requirements

> **NOTE**: Before you start, the build process can take several hours depending on your hardware specifications. On a machine with the specs below, compiling CARLA took around **5+ hours**.

- **Operating System**: 64-bit Windows 10 or 11
- **Processor**: Quad-core Intel or AMD processor, 2.5 GHz or faster
  - *Example*: Intel Core i7-12700H @ 2.30 GHz
- **Memory (RAM)**: 32 GB (recommended)
- **Graphics Card**: Dedicated GPU with at least 6 GB VRAM (8 GB recommended)
- **Disk Space**: Approximately 165 GB total
  - CARLA: ~32 GB
  - Unreal Engine and related software: ~133 GB
- **TCP Ports**: Ensure ports **2000** and **2001** are open (default for CARLA)

### Software Requirements

> **IMPORTANT**:  
> - If you have multiple Python versions installed, make sure **Python 3.8 can be found first** (Python 3.10 won't work for certain).
> - **DO NOT** attempt to use a virtual environment for building the CARLA package.

Here is the toolchain I used:

- **Git**: Version control system for cloning repositories
- **CMake**: Version 3.15 or higher
- **Make**: Version 3.81 (strictly required)
- **7-Zip**: For extracting compressed files
- **Python 3.8 (64-bit)**: Required for CARLA (avoid 32-bit versions)
- **Visual Studio 2022**: Community Edition is sufficient
- **Unreal Engine 4.26 (CARLA fork)**: Custom version required for CARLA

Ensure all software is added to the system's `PATH` environment variable.

### Python Dependencies

- **Pip**: Version 20.3 or higher
- **Setuptools**: For building and distributing Python packages
- **Wheel**: For building wheel archives

### Download Assets

> NOTE: If this is missing at run-time (`make launch-only`) a segmentation fault will raise.

Download scenarios asssets:

```powershell
Update.bat
```

### Install Python Packages

> **IMPORTANT**:  
> - Do **not** compile CARLA in a virtual environment as this may cause a `B2.EXE` (boost library) error.  
> - This process must be executed natively (system-wide) and with **Python 3.8 specifically**.  
> - If multiple Python versions are installed, ensure Python 3.8 is at the top of your `PATH`.

Check your Python version:

```powershell
python --version
```

Should output:

```powershell
Python 3.8.XX    # XX can be any version
```

Install necessary Python packages, **if this package is not installed system wide the package won't be generated** even if there's a "success" message:

```powershell
pip install wheel
```

Verify installed packages:

```powershell
pip list
```

Confirm your `pip` version:

```powershell
pip --version
```

### Compile the Python API

> **NOTES**:  
> - The build process defaults to Visual Studio 2019. **Since we're using Visual Studio 2022, we need to specify it**.  
> - Ensure Python 3.8 is the top version in the system `PATH`.  
> - This process can take around **30 minutes**.

Open the **x64 Native Tools Command Prompt for VS 2022**. Navigate to your CARLA directory:

```powershell
cd C:\carla-0.9.15
```

Compile the Python API:

```powershell
make PythonAPI GENERATOR="Visual Studio 17 2022"
```

#### Troubleshooting Boost Library Issues

If you encounter an error related to the Boost libraries, it's likely because the Boost libraries were built with a different version of the Microsoft Visual C++ (MSVC) compiler. Visit [this GitHub issue](https://github.com/carla-simulator/carla/issues/7082) for reference.

Error Message:

```
LINK : fatal error LNK1104: cannot open file 'libboost_filesystem-vc142-mt-x64-1_80.lib'
```

Explanation:

- The Boost libraries were built with MSVC version **14.2** (Visual Studio 2019).  
- You're using MSVC **14.3** (Visual Studio 2022).  
- The linker expects Boost libraries for `vc143`.

Solution:

1. **Delete the Current Boost Installation**:

   ```powershell
   rm -r .\Build\boost-1.80.0-install\
   ```

2. **Install Boost with the Correct Toolset**:

   ```powershell
   .\Util\InstallersWin\install_boost.bat --build-dir "C:\carla-0.9.15\Build\" --toolset msvc-14.3 --version 1.80.0 -j 32
   ```

   Notes:  
   - `--toolset msvc-14.3` specifies the correct MSVC version.  
   - `-j 32` uses 32 cores for parallel compilation (adjust according to your CPU).

3. **Rebuild the Python API**:

   ```powershell
   make PythonAPI
   ```

### Compile the CARLA Server

> **NOTE**: This step will take several hours (2+ hours).

Compile the CARLA server:

```powershell
make CarlaUE4Editor GENERATOR="Visual Studio 17 2022"
```

This command compiles the server without launching it immediately. The output files will be created at:

```powershell
C:\carla-0.9.15\PythonAPI\carla\dist
```

## Launching the CARLA Simulator

### Changing the Default Map (Optional)

By default, CARLA loads `Town10HD_Opt`, which is large and resource-intensive. If you have limited resources, consider switching to a lighter map like `Town02`.

1. **Edit Configuration File**: Open `Unreal\CarlaUE4\Config\DefaultEngine.ini` in a text editor.

2. **Modify Map Settings**:

   Replace the map settings with the following:

   ```ini
   [/Script/EngineSettings.GameMapsSettings]
   EditorStartupMap=/Game/Carla/Maps/Town02.Town02  
   GameDefaultMap=/Game/Carla/Maps/Town02.Town02  
   ServerDefaultMap=/Game/Carla/Maps/Town02.Town02  
   GlobalDefaultGameMode=/Game/Carla/Blueprints/Game/CarlaGameMode.CarlaGameMode_C  
   GameInstanceClass=/Script/Carla.CarlaGameInstance  
   TransitionMap=/Game/Carla/Maps/Town02.Town02  
   GlobalDefaultServerGameMode=/Game/Carla/Blueprints/Game/CarlaGameMode.CarlaGameMode_C
   ```

### Launch the CARLA Server

> **NOTE**:  
> - Launching the simulation takes time. It might seem it gets stuck at 95%, but it's not.  
> - For this setup, it took around **20 minutes** to open the Editor and another **30 minutes** to start the simulation as shading and object rendering occur.  
> - This only happens once; subsequent launches will be much faster due to caching.

Now, let's launch the CARLA server:

```powershell
make launch-only
```

After loading, this is how it will look like if using `Town02`:

![launch-only capture]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/posts/2024-09-29-carla-win11/carla-launch-server.png)

Now click **Play** in the Unreal Editor to start the simulation.

![Starting Simulation]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/posts/2024-09-29-carla-win11/carla-play-button.png)

In-Game View:

![In-Game View]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/posts/2024-09-29-carla-win11/carla-sim-start.png)

*You can move around using the WASD keys and look around with the mouse, just like in any first-person game.*

## Running the CARLA Client

### Creating a Python Virtual Environment

> **IMPORTANT**:  
> - Do **NOT** create a virtual environment until the build process is complete to avoid any potential errors (with `B2.EXE`).  
> - Ensure Python 3.8 is the version used in the virtual environment.

**Create the Virtual Environment**:

```powershell
py -3.8 -m venv .venv
```

**Activate the Virtual Environment**:

```powershell
.\.venv\Scripts\activate
```

### Installing the CARLA Package

Navigate to the CARLA Python API distribution directory and install the package:

```powershell
cd C:\carla-0.9.15\PythonAPI\carla\dist  
pip install .\carla-0.9.15-cp38-cp38-win_amd64.whl
```

### Installing Example Dependencies

Install dependencies for the example scripts:

```powershell
cd C:\carla-0.9.15\PythonAPI\examples  
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Starting Traffic Simulation

> **NOTE**: Ensure the CARLA server is running before executing client scripts.

You can now run example scripts to interact with the simulation. For instance, to generate traffic:

```powershell
python generate_traffic.py
```

You should now see traffic in the simulation.

**Example Output**:
